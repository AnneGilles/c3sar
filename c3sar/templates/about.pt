    <h1>about C3S</h1>
    <div id="about">
    
      <p>
	C3S is a new upcoming European collecting society
	for Artists and Bands to register their works.</p>

      <p>
	Members can choose to upload their works or not. 
	They can also choose to link to works they have uploaded elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>.</p>

      <p>
	Featurewise this collecting society will be a system
	not specifically designed to replace GEMA and the others,
	but we will offer all features they do. And many more.
      </p>

      <p>.</p>

      <p>
	We will actually be making an announcement and offer 
	to all members of GEMA et al. It is likely to be equal or 
	better than the current deals. We'll see.
      </p>

      <p>.</p>

      <p>This was designed to take the process of licensing
	of cultural work to the internet level. 
	Of course we will have to produce a paper trail.
	Making contracts still requires dead wood and a signature...
      </p>
